Part I)
The forward euler method causes the energy of the object to increase
infinitely, so eventually the pendulum rotates 360 degrees without falling
down. The backward euler method causes the energy of the object to decrease
to 0, so eventually the pendulum stops moving. The sympletic euler method,
however, keeps the energy of the pendulum approximately constant, so the 
pendulum keeps swinging for a long time with about the same energy. Thus,
the sympletic euler method creates a better approximation of reality. For this
reason, I would choose the sympletic euler method.
