# CS2 Assignment 1: Sorting in Python
# 
# This file defines a class SorterApplication that implements a number
# of useful interfaces. The class is capable of generating and storing
# a list of random numbers and is capable of constructing a Tkinter
# window enabling the user to visualise the sorting process.
# 
# Instances of the class also provide an interface to a list that is to
# be sorted. List elements may be read, but not written, by subscripting
# the instance. List elements may be swapped, given their indices, using
# a provided public function.
#
# The functions providing the user interface and API are contained in a
# separate superclass called SorterApplicationBase, defined in a separate
# file. The student's work builds on top of the functionality provided by
# the base class.
#
# The student is tasked with writing a class member function that sorts
# the list in place. The student is only to use the given member functions
# to manipulate the list; the student is not to modify the list
# directly. If implemented correctly, the student should be able to
# verify the correctness of the implementation by clicking a button on
# the Tkinter interface to initiate the animation process.
