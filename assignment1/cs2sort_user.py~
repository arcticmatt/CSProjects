# CS2 Assignment 1: Sorting in Python
# 
# This file defines a class SorterApplication that implements a number
# of useful interfaces. The class is capable of generating and storing
# a list of random numbers and is capable of constructing a Tkinter
# window enabling the user to visualise the sorting process.
# 
# Instances of the class also provide an interface to a list that is to
# be sorted. List elements may be read, but not written, by subscripting
# the instance. List elements may be swapped, given their indices, using
# a provided public function.
#
# The functions providing the user interface and API are contained in a
# separate superclass called SorterApplicationBase, defined in a separate
# file. The student's work builds on top of the functionality provided by
# the base class.
#
# The student is tasked with writing a class member function that sorts
# the list in place. The student is only to use the given member functions
# to manipulate the list; the student is not to modify the list
# directly. If implemented correctly, the student should be able to
# verify the correctness of the implementation by clicking a button on
# the Tkinter interface to initiate the animation process.

    Students are expected to use the Swap() function for list manipulation and 
    use the Compare() function for element comparison. Unfortunately, this 
    requirement (necessary for the style of visualizer used) precludes the 
    implementation of sorting methods that cannot operate in place.
