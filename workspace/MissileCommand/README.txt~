Modifications:
	1) Missiles have lateral velocity.
	2) Missiles bounce off walls.
	3) Missiles change colors continuously.
	4) Your score decreases when missiles hit the buildings.
	5) The background is outerspace.
	6) Your score increments as you kill more missiles with single
	   explosions: 
	   -Single kill = 10 points
	   -Double kill = 25 * 2 points
	   -Triple kill = 50 * 3 points
	   -Quadruple (and above) kill = 100 * k points
	7) The rate at which missiles spawn is determined by the amount
	   of cycles which have passed since the game started, and the
	   number of missiles on the field. This gives us exponential 
	   growth in the number of missiles on the field.
	8) You have 2 nukes, which you can use by pressing the right mouse.
	9) You are classified as a failure at life, noob, amateur, or pro
	   based upon your final score.
	10) Additions to your score are posted on the playing field.
	11) The speed of missiles is partially determined by the number of
	missiles already on the field, preventing hoardes of missiles & abusing
	nukes on hoardes to massively increase your score.
	12) Hitting buildings decreases your power level (and score).
