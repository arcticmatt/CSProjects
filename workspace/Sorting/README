Build the project by typing

javac *.java

After bulding run the application by typing

java SortingApplication

While the application is running the following commands are available:

spacebar - Run and display the sort.
r - Refresh with a new random array.
escape - Exit.

The main class is defined in SortingApplication.java. The number of elements to
be sorted can be changed by editing the ARRAY_SIZE constant at the top of this
file. To toggle the visualization of comparisons, change the TRACK_COMPARISONS
variable at the top of this file.

The drawing logic is defined in SortingPanel.java, and various aspects of the user
interface can be customized by editing constants at the top of this file.

BaseSorter.java defines an abstract base class which can keep track of comparisons
and swaps. To implement a new sorting method, define a class which extends BaseSorter
and overrides the doSort() method and sorts the array. In this method, swaps and
comparisons between array methods should be done using the swap() and lessThan()
methods defined in BaseSorter.
